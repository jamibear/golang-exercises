### Map vs Struct 

Map 
- All keys are of the same type 
- All values are of the same type 
- Keys are indexed and interative
- Use to represent a collection of related properties 
- Don't need to know all keys at compile time 
- is a reference type 

Struct 
- Values can be different type 
- Keys don't support indexing 
- You need to know all the different fields at compile time 
- Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties 
- is a value type
